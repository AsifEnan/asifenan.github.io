## Favorite \[ugliest\] plot

\footnotesize One of my favorite assignments in STAT-850 was creating an intentional ugly plot which violates many of the basic principles of good plot making. We used the palmer penguins dataset and my work looked like this:

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm)) +
   geom_text(aes(label = species, color = species), size = 10)+
  # geom_point(size=5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "green", "ivory")) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2500, 6500), breaks = seq(2500, 6500, by = 70)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(30, 60), breaks = seq(30, 60, by = 0.3)) +  
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 40, size = 0.5, linetype="dashed")+
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),  # Black panel background
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),   # Black overall plot background
    panel.grid = element_line(color = "white"),       # White grid lines to contrast with black
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),        # White axis text to stand out
    axis.title = element_text(color = "white",face = "bold"),       # White axis labels
    legend.title = element_text(color = "blue", size = 12),
    legend.text = element_text(color = "purple", size = 10),
    plot.title = element_text(color = "white", size = 16, face = "bold") #White title
  )+
  labs(title = "Scatterplot showing the relationship between bill length vs body mass \nof 3 species of penguins", x="Body mass (in grams)", y="Bill length (in millimeters)")
```
