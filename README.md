# asifenan.github.io

My first githubs pages site.I am making this github page as part of STAT-850 course, but I plan on updating this page gradually and turn this into a personal website of sort

## What it currently contains

Right now it should contain two presentations that I made

-   One using [beamer](Intro_beamer.qmd). If you want to view the pdf output, click [here](Intro_beamer.pdf)

-   Other using [revealjs](Intro_revealjs.html)

-   And my [CV](EnanCV_US.pdf)
