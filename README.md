# asifenan.github.io

My first githubs pages site. I am making this github page as part of **STAT-850 course**, but I plan on updating this page gradually and turn this into a personal website of sort

## What it currently contains

Right now it should contain two presentations slides that I made

-   The presentation I made using [beamer](Intro_beamer.pdf).

-   The other using [revealjs](Intro_revealjs.html)

-   And my [CV](EnanCV_US.pdf)

The code for everything including the LateX template that I used for my CV is in the github repository for this page. Click [here](https://github.com/AsifEnan/asifenan.github.io)
